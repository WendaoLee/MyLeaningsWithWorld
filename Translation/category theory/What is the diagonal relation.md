The identity of P×P

is just as it says; it is the entire set P×P. (I have no idea why it's called that.) So it has |P|2

elements.

The diagonal of P×P

is the set {(a,a):a∈P}, so it has |P| elements. Another way it can be written is {(a,b):a,b∈P,a=b}. The reason it is called the diagonal is that, for instance when P=R is the real line, the diagonal is the graph of y=x in R×R

-- it's a diagonal line.

Note that they are both subsets of P×P
